# Data-Clustering
Original dataset was gotten from kaggle on- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mihailisman/telecom and had already been preprocessed using python.
INTRODUCTION TO THE DATASET
This dataset contains 1 table, in CSV format:
â€¢ The Customer Churn table contains information on all 7,043 customers from a Telecommunications company in California in Q2 2022. After preprocessing, only 500 rows are used for this purpose.
Clustering techniques used are K-means, Aggloremative Heirachical clustering and DBSCAN based on two variables which are- "Total revenue" and "customer ID" with teh end goal of discovering inherent structures, patterns, and relationships within this dataset.



Decision Tree, Rule, and Neural Network Accuracy:

This code utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, decision rules, and neural networks, to classify and evaluate customer churn in a telecommunications dataset. It aims to provide insights and predictive models that assist in understanding customer behavior and improving customer retention strategies. The code measures the accuracy of these models in predicting whether customers stay or churn.

Decision Tree Accuracy: Decision trees are employed to create classification models that segment customers based on various features and behaviors. The accuracy of these decision tree models is assessed to determine how well they predict customer churn.

Rule Accuracy: Decision rules are extracted from decision trees to provide interpretable, human-readable insights into the factors influencing customer churn. The accuracy of these rules is evaluated to understand their reliability.

Neural Network Accuracy: Neural networks, a deep learning technique, are used to build predictive models. The accuracy of these models is examined to assess their effectiveness in predicting customer churn.

Goal of the Code:

Identify factors that influence customer churn in the telecommunications dataset.
Create models that accurately predict whether a customer will stay or churn.
Evaluate the performance of these models, considering accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Provide interpretable decision rules to understand the decision-making process of the models.
Visualize the decision tree with the highest accuracy to gain insights into the model's structure.
